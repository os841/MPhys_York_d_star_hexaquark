The dâˆ— hexaquark Bose-Einstein Condensate
has a unique self-interaction that can explain the variation in rotation curves between
galaxies and the variety seen in dark matter distributions. Using first principles to lay
a secure foundation, this unknown and complex system could contain thousands or
even millions of hexaquarks. Discovering the complex interplay between mass and ve-
locity across parameter space has revealed fascinating kinematics never seen before.

#Hexaquark Exchange Code
The results obtained place novel estimates on the parameterised binding energy and
density ratio to baryonic matter that governs the condensate mass.

#Meson Exchange
Create a picture of hexaquark self-interaction using the deuteron as a fermionic
analogy to study the bosonic objects. 

#Dark matter density distribution as SIDM
Finally, the dark matter density distribution of the Milky Way will be modelled using 
the kinematics derived from the hexaquark exchange code of this model. 

The unique properties
provide a promising dark matter candidate to explain the cosmological structure and
potentially naturally occurring hadronic Bose-einstein Condensates.
